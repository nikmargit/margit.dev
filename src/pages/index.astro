    <h1>👋 I'm Nikola Margit</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a web developer based in Belgrade, Serbia. Currently, I contribute as
      a React developer at <a href="https://cake.com/">CAKE.com</a>, where my
      focus lies in creating visually appealing, interactive, and engaging user
      interfaces. I am dedicated to the principles of accessibility, ensuring
      that the things I craft are inclusive and user-friendly.
    </p><p>
      My blog serves as a learning diary in my continuous exploration of new
      concepts and technologies. It's a space where I document the challenges
      and insights encountered on my journey through the ever-evolving landscape
      of web development.
